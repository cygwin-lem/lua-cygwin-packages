ldesc: "LuaCov is a simple coverage analysis tool for Lua scripts.
When a Lua script is run with the luacov module, it
generates a stats file. The luacov command-line script then
processes this file generating a report indicating which code
paths were not traversed, which is useful for verifying the
effectiveness of a test suite.
